Front yard
======================================================================================================
One second she was here the next she was gone. Your dog losty just ran away.

   Look
   ----
   
   You're looking at the beautiful front yard of 404 Foundleroy Road.
   A picket fence surrounds the mansion in front of you.
   There seems to be only one way into the building. A large oak [door].
   This looks like some kind of maniac lives here.
   
   You here barking.
   
   Your friends <insert friends> are here.


   Listen
   ------
   You here distant barking. It definitely comes from the mansion in front of you.


   Look door
   ---------
   A sturdy wooden [door].


   Knock door (open)
   -----------------
   You knock on an open [door]. Still no one answers.
   
   Knock door (closed)
   -------------------
   You knock on the [door]. No one answers.

   Kick door (open)
   ----------------
   The open [door] hits the back wall and then swings back and hits your face.
   
   Kick door (closed)
   ------------------
   As the old saying goes: 'This will hurt you a lot more than it will the [door].'

   Open door (closed)  ->  door open, unlock entry hall
   ----------------------------------------------------
   The [door] swings open. Who doesn't lock their front [door]?
   
   Open door (open)
   ----------------
   You open the [door] as much as possible.


======================================================================================================
Entry Hall
======================================================================================================

Look
----

You are in a great hall. The floor has a black and white checker pattern.
To your left is the [wardrobe] and to your right a small table with a [phone]

In the middle of the hall, on both sides in the wall, you'll find two doors.

Both the <kitchen door state(open)>[kitchen door]<kitchen door state(closed)>[left door]</> and the <kitchen door state(open)>[living room door]<kitchen door state(closed)>[right door]</> are made of a massive dark wood.

In the back of the hall is a wide [staircase]. You can also see a [window] on the back of the room if you look past the [staircase].

The barking gets loader.

Look wardrobe
-------------
The wardrobe can hold many coats and cloaks. But it is empty.

Look phone
-------------
An old dark phone with an dialplate. The decorative numbers are written on a white circle.

The 6 looks very used.

Look left|kitchen door
----------------------
The massive door from dark wood must have been once very beautiful. You see some water marks on the side where the door has swollen up a little.

Look right|living room door
----------------------
The massive door from dark wood is still in good condition.


Look staircase
----------------------
Like many elements in this room the stair is made of a dark wood. But it looks old and not in a good way. It could be a hazard.

In the side of the staircase is a [metal door].


Look window
----------------------
You look in the garden at the back of the hose.

It could need some care...

Look metal door
----------------------
A very study door. It would be blast to open it.
