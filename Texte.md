   Look
   ----
   
   You're looking at the beautiful front yard of 404 Foundleroy Road.
   A picket fence surrounds the mansion in front of you.
   There seems to be only one way into the building. A large oak [door].
   This looks like some kind of maniac lives here.
   
   You here barking.
   
   Your friends <insert friends> are here.

   Knock door (closed)
   -------------------
   You knock on the [door]. No one answers.

   Kick door (open)
   ----------------
   The open [door] hits the back wall and then swings back and hits your face.
   
   Kick door (closed)
   ------------------
   As the old saying goes: 'This will hurt you a lot more than it will the [door].'

    In the middle of the hall, on both sides in the wall, you'll find two doors.

    Both the <kitchen door state(open)>[dining room door]<kitchen door state(closed)>[left door]</> and the <kitchen door state(open)>[living room door]<kitchen door state(closed)>[right door]</> are made of a massive dark wood.
